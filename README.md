# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

We build a social media app called ‚ÄúStay in touch‚Äù.

As a guest user:

- I want to be able to create account/log in.
- I can see only ‚ÄúSign in‚Äù and ‚ÄúSign out‚Äù page.

As a logged-in user:

- I want to be able to see all users list.
- I want to be able to see selected user page with their user name and all posts written by them (the most recent posts on the top).
- I want to be able to send a friendship invitation.
- I want to see a button ‚ÄúInvite to friendship‚Äù next to the name of user who is not my friend yet - on both users‚Äô list and single user page.
- I want to be able to see pending friendship invitations sent to me from other users.
- I want to be able to accept or reject friendships invitation.
- I want to be able to create new posts (text only).
- I want to be able to like/dislike posts (but I can like single post only once).
- I want to be able to add comments to posts.
- Timeline page should be the root page of the app.
